# PWM

### PWM is useful for controlling the average power or amplitude delivered by an electrical signal.

 The longer the switch is on, the higher the total power supplied to the load.


 The rectangular voltage pulses nonetheless result in a more and more smooth current waveform, as the switching frequency increases. The current waveform is the integral of the voltage waveform.

The main advantage of PWM is that power loss in the switching devices is very low.
